    A note on the name "S2_MIMICRY": the FL literature has a specific,
    different "Mimic" attack (Karimireddy, He & Jaggi, ICLR 2022) where
    Byzantine workers replicate a single honest worker's update to bias
    aggregation on heterogeneous data. That is NOT what this function
    does -- it runs a directed-deviation / Min-Max-style optimization
    attack against the cosine-similarity spatial check. The dispatch key
    is left unchanged since renaming it would ripple through the rest of
    the codebase, but it is worth knowing the name is a false friend if a
    reviewer familiar with Karimireddy et al. reads the paper.

    Fix changelog (this revision)
    -------------------------------
    - S2_MIMICRY [critical, logic bug]: the previous perturbation
      direction was constructed *orthogonal* to the reference vector via
      Gram-Schmidt from a random per-client seed. Because the direction
      was orthogonal, cos(candidate, ref) was NOT monotonic in the search
      variable epsilon -- it rises, peaks, then falls -- so the bisection
      (which assumes monotonic decrease) converged to an arbitrary point
      rather than the true maximum whenever the honest gradient had a
      negative component along that random direction (roughly half of all
      draws). This silently produced a much weaker attack than intended
      about half the time, with no error raised. Fixed by switching to
      the literature-standard "inverse unit vector" direction
      v = -ref/||ref|| (Shejwalkar & Houmansadr, 2021), for which
      monotonicity is provable by construction (see
      `_directed_epsilon_max`'s docstring) -- the bisection is now sound
      for every draw, and the attack is also strictly stronger, since
      pushing directly against the trust anchor is more damaging than an
      orthogonal offset. The static seeded "malicious objective" is no
      longer needed and has been removed.
      Empirical check (d=200, 400 random trials, theta_target=0.55):
      the old orthogonal direction produced a genuinely non-monotonic
      cosine curve in 47.0% of draws. Most of those cost only a little
      accuracy in high dimension -- concentration of measure keeps a
      random orthogonal component's contribution small relative to
      ||delta_W||, so the bisection lands close to the true optimum
      anyway -- but 0.5% of draws were unambiguous failures: the true
      feasible window excluded epsilon=0 entirely, and the old code
      (which implicitly assumes epsilon=0 is always a valid starting
      point) returned ~0 instead of the real, much larger optimum that
      existed further out. Which draws are affected is unpredictable
      per client per round, so this quietly added unquantified
      noise/bias into any attack-strength numbers computed from the old
      code, and the failure rate is expected to be *higher* for
      lower-dimensional per-layer tensors or for theta_cos values tuned
      close to where honest updates naturally sit -- i.e. exactly the
      regime a well-tuned defense's threshold usually lives in.
    - S2_MIMICRY [robustness]: the previous upper search bound
      (2 * ||delta_W||) was a fixed guess that is not guaranteed to
      bracket the true root for all values of theta_cos. Replaced with an
      exponential bracket-expansion step before bisecting, and an
      explicit epsilon=0 feasibility check (if even the honest update
      can't clear the margin, it is returned unmodified rather than the
      old code's undefined behaviour).
    - ADAPTIVE [same critical bug]: the spatial payload reused the same
      orthogonal Gram-Schmidt construction as the old S2 and inherited
      the identical monotonicity bug. Fixed the same way, with a small
      verified-and-bounded orthogonal jitter layered on top (not a raw
      unchecked one) so the round-to-round "morphing" behaviour survives
      without reopening the soundness problem.
    - T1 / T2 / S1: no logic bugs found. Left mathematically as-is;
      hardcoded magic numbers (noise scale, sign-flip scale) were pulled
      into `self.config` with the original values as defaults, so
      existing experiment results are reproducible unless you opt into
      different constants. Docstrings now cite the papers each already
      matches.

        r"""Adaptive adversary: modulates timing based on P_i trend, and
        uses the same directed-deviation spatial payload as S2 with a
        small, *verified* orthogonal jitter layered on top each round so
        the attack direction is not perfectly static (evading a
        trajectory-consistency style defense signal) without reopening
        the monotonicity bug S2 had. See the class changelog.

        Timing rule (unchanged, no bug found):
        - :math:`\Delta P < -0.05` (falling): slow to :math:`1.2 \cdot g` (recover pace)
        - :math:`\Delta P > +0.05` (recovering): speed up to :math:`0.8 \cdot g`
        - otherwise: maintain :math:`g_{\text{honest}}`

        Spatial rule: find :math:`\varepsilon_{\max}` exactly as in S2,
        back off to ``adaptive_epsilon_safety`` (default 0.9) of it to
        leave headroom, then add a jitter vector orthogonal to the trust
        anchor, scaled to a fraction of the epsilon used
        (``adaptive_morph_jitter``, default 0.3). The jittered candidate's
        cosine similarity is checked before being committed; if the
        jitter would drop it below the target, the un-jittered candidate
        is used instead for that round.

        Evaluating a defense against an attacker with knowledge of the
        defense mechanism (this function) is the methodology argued for
        in Shejwalkar, Houmansadr, Kairouz & Ramage, "Back to the Drawing
        Board", IEEE S&P 2022.
